# VoIP over Super SIM Demo

This repo contains a [Twilio Functions](https://www.twilio.com/docs/runtime/functions) application which creates and wires up a new [Twilio Programmable Voice SIP Domain](https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/sip/api/sip-domain-resource) to enable incoming and outgoing VoIP calls to and from IoT devices.

The code accompanies the Super SIM tutorial [How to Make and Take IoT VoIP via Super SIM](https://www.twilio.com/docs/iot/supersim/how-to-make-and-take-iot-voip-calls-via-super-sim), and you should check out that guide to learn how to set up and run the VoIP demo.
